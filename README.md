# Required reading materials to start research at RVL
A curated collection of papers and research materials that students need to be aware of when they are getting started with research in the lab. They are categorized here in terms of topics:

## How to Move

### Planning
Week 5, Motion Planning, from Florian's [CSC477](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/courses/csc477_fall19/)  

### Control Theory and Learning
Lecture 7 on LQR, from Florian's [COMP417](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~florian/courses/comp417/website/)  

[Underactuated robotics course at MIT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChfUOAhz7ynELF-s_1LPpWg/playlists), 2020 version, from Russ Tedrake. Also check out his [online book](http://underactuated.mit.edu/underactuated.html) on the same topic. 

All of Steve Brunton's [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm5mt-A4w61lknZ9lCsZtBw/playlists) on learning for control are interesting, but the following playlists in particular are worth understanding: 
* [Koopman Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5CRbC4yqnk&list=PLMrJAkhIeNNSVXUvppZTYNHKQUD-oWys9), which turns nonlinear dynamics problems into linear. 
* [Data-Driven Dynamical Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kap3TZwAsv0&list=PLMrJAkhIeNNR6DzT17-MM1GHLkuYVjhyt), which presents techniques for learning dynamical systems from data
* [Data-Driven Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oulLR06lj_E&list=PLMrJAkhIeNNQkv98vuPjO2X2qJO_UPeWR), which presents techniques for learning controllers from data, using learned dynamical systems.

### Imitation Learning
Florian's [imitation learning seminar course](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/courses/imitation_learning/). Look at the slides. 

### Reinforcement Learning
[RL course at UCL](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/), by David Silver. Check out the slides and youtube videos. This course is good for discrete RL in games like chess and Go, so definitely not tailored to robotics.

[Deep RL course at Berkeley](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/), by Sergey Levine. Check out the youtube videos. This course is good for both discrete and continuous state and action RL, so it is applicable to robotics.

### Learning to Plan/Search
David Duvenaud's [seminar course](https://duvenaud.github.io/learning-to-search/)

Yisong Yue's [seminar course](https://sites.google.com/view/cs-159-spring-2020/home)
